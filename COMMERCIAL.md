## FAQ

**Q: What if I'm just evaluating?**
A: Evaluation is always free under the FSL. Take your time.

**Q: Can I use it in CI/CD pipelines?**
A: Internal CI/CD is fine. If your CI/CD produces artifacts for customers that
include LeanCert verification, you need a license.

**Q: What about consulting/contracting?**
A: If you're building something for a client, the client needs the license
(not you as the contractor).

**Q: Do contributions require a CLA?**
A: Yes, contributors must sign a Contributor License Agreement granting us
the right to include their contributions under these terms.

**Q: What happens when the FSL converts to Apache 2.0?**
A: After January 17, 2028, that specific version becomes fully open source.
Newer versions will have their own 3-year countdown.
