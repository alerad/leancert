# LeanCert Showcase

Demonstrations of verified numerical computation in Lean 4.

## What This Library Does

LeanCert proves facts about real-valued functions using **interval arithmetic**.
The key idea: compute with rational intervals, get proofs about reals.

## Highlights

1. **Transcendental bounds**: exp, sin, cos with Taylor model error bounds
2. **Root existence**: Prove √2 exists via sign change
3. **Root absence**: Prove functions stay away from zero
4. **Composition**: Combine operations freely

## The Golden Theorem Pattern

Each verified result follows this pattern:
1. Build an `Expr` (expression AST) or use raw Lean syntax
2. Run interval evaluation → get rational bounds
3. Use `native_decide` to check the bound
4. Golden theorem lifts to a proof about reals

/-! ## Why This Matters

1. **Verified**: Every bound is machine-checked by Lean's kernel
2. **Computational**: Bounds computed at compile time via `native_decide`
3. **Composable**: Build complex proofs from simple pieces
4. **Automated**: Tactics handle boilerplate

The library automates numerical verification where symbolic methods are tedious.
